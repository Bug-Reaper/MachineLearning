# DCGAN_pytorch
DCGAN implementation of the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) in PyTorch. I tried to stay as close to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) as possible.


Most of the values used in the implementation are straight from the paper.
The implemented structure of the network is the one depicted in the paper as well:

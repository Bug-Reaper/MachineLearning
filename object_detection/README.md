# Object Detection

After studying and playing around with CNNs I'll continue with computer vision and start with object localization and object detection.

### Roadmap
* 1st Object Localization
    * single object
    * Dataset: [The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/devdgohil/the-oxfordiiit-pet-dataset)
* 2nd step Object Detection
    * [YOLO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) implementation

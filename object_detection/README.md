# Object Detection

After studying and playing around with CNNs I'll continue with computer vision and start with object localization and object detection.

### Roadmap
* 1st step - learn about Object Localization (I will probably delete this after implementing it better for object detection)
    * learn core concepts of object localization
    * **just to experiment - the code is a mess**
    * test on [The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/devdgohil/the-oxfordiiit-pet-dataset)


* **2nd step - Object Detection** *On Hold*
    * **this is the main part**
    * study [OverFeat: Integrated Recognition, Localization and Detection using Conv Nets Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6229)
    * [YOLO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) implementation

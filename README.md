# Machine Learning

This is where I learn machine learningü§∑‚Äç  This means that this repo covers no specific topic of machine learning or a project - I work in here when I want to learn/try something

I'll try to keep it orgamised but I don't want it to be too nested because that becomes a pain to navigate, instead I'll try to keet the table of content up-to-date.

**If I use a jupyter notebook I'm experimenting with something and the code will probably be a mess ... so don't take those too serious.**

## Table of Content

* [Neural Style Transfer - implementation in PyTorch](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/Neural_Style_Transfer)

### Model/Architecture implementations
* [VGG16](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/CNN_Architectures/vgg16.py)

### Working on
* [Object detection](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/Object_Detection)

# MachineLearning

This is where I learn machine learningü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'll try to keep it orgamised but I don't want it to be too nested because that becomes a pain to navigate, instead I'll try to keet the table of content up-to-date.

## Table of Content
* [Transfer Learning for Conputer vision](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/transfer_learning_cv)
* [DCGAN paper implementation in PyTorch](https://github.com/wilhelmberghammer/MachineLearning/tree/main/DCGAN_pytorch)

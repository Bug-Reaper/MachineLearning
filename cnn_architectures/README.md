# CNN architecture implementations in PyTorch


## VGG
Simple PyTorch implementation of the paper [VERY DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR LARGE-SCALE IMAGE RECOGNITION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf)

I made VGG16 (D) because it's the most popular and the architecute can be modified.

**This is just for fun** and to get a better feeling for VGG models when using the pretrained ones ... I didn't train this model I just imprelemted the architectue (I also added the hyperparameters of the training from the paper)
I didn't implement the training-loop either because I didn't intented to train the thing, plus the training-loop is not the main part of the paper.
